In one of the eastern districts of Ukraine alone the local official stated that since the war kicked up on the 24th of February they had lost '50' of their 250 ambulances or were too out of action due to shrapnel and other effects of the war. So these being sent along with the other armoured vehicles will DEFINITELY go a long way in helping the civilians as well as the soldiers and other first responders.
